<h1>Assembly language is a low-level computer programming language</h1>
<p> that translates high-level languages into machine language.
It's also known as Assembler and is often abbreviated as ASM. Assembly language is processor-dependent and translates mnemonics into commands that a specific CPU can understand. </p>

<p>Assembly language is a symbolic representation of machine language, with each assembly instruction corresponding to a specific machine instruction.
It's closer to the machine code that the CPU can execute, making it more powerful than other higher-level languages. </p>

<p>Assembly language is used in some niche applications where performance requirements are high, such as in security research, reverse engineering software, and making operating systems.
However, it's rarely written directly today because it's complex and difficult to learn, especially for beginners.
It's also highly machine dependent, which limits portability, and the code can be difficult to maintain, especially for large projects</p>
